### Contributing to GSPulse

GSPulse welcomes user contributions! For suggesting small changes, go ahead
and open a PR and request a review. For big changes, we recommend opening 
an issue and initiating some discussion before implementing code changes. 

In both cases, we will likely not implement the changes directly to the 
open-source repository but instead implement the changes on our internal 
version, perform testing, and then mirror the changes to the open-source
repo. 

Feel free to reach out to Josiah Wai, jwai@cfs.energy.
